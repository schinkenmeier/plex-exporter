Doch dann passiert eine Tragödie und bei der Geburt verstirbt eines der Kinder. Das Schicksal bringt ihnen jedoch Randall, einen kleinen Jungen, der am selben Tag wie die Zwillinge geboren und von seinen Eltern verstoßen wurde. Jahre später geht jedes der Kinder seinen eigenen Weg: Während Randall ein erfolgreicher Geschäftsmann ist, versucht Kevin sein Glück als Schauspieler. Kate leidet unterdessen sehr unter ihrem Aussehen. Und doch sind alle drei eigentlich nur auf der Suche nach der tieferen Bedeutung des Lebens.","tagline":"This is real. This is love.
