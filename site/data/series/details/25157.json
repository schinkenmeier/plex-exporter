{"ratingKey":25157,"type":"tv","title":"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia","year":2005,"summary":"Die vier egozentrischen Freunde Mac, Charlie, Dennis und seine Zwillingsschwester ‘Sweet Dee’ führen gemeinsam das Irish Pub Paddy’s in Philadelphia. Die Geschäfte laufen mehr schlecht als recht und die Existenz der Kneipe steht ständig auf der Kippe. Und so auch die Freundschaft der Gang, die täglich auf eine neue, harte Probe gestellt wird und meist in beleidigenden Diskussionen und Streitereien endet. Einen wesentlichen Teil des ganz normalen Wahnsinns der Pub-Besitzer verantwortet das plötzliche Auftauchen von Dennis’ und Dees Vater Frank. Von Episode zu Episode werden die Abenteuer der vier Chaoten extremer und lassen kein Thema unberührt: Rassismus, Sexismus, Alkoholismus und der amerikanische Traum werden für die Gang zum Gegenstand immer neuer Fettnäppfchen  – genau das Richtige für Fans von Comedy an der Schmerzgrenze.","tagline":"Good [Crossed Out].
