{"ratingKey":21369,"type":"tv","title":"Drawn Together","year":2004,"summary":"Drawn Together ist eine US-amerikanische Zeichentrickserie, die Film und Fernsehen persifliert. Der derbe Humor mit viel Sexbezug und Gewalt richtet sich ausschließlich an ein erwachsenes Publikum. Die Deutschsprachige Erstausstrahlung erfolgte am 3. Mai 2006 auf MTV Germany.\n\nDie Handlung ist an das Konzept von Reality-Shows angelehnt. Unterschiedliche Personen werden in einem Haus untergebracht und dabei von Kameras beobachtet. Comedy Central machte damit Werbung, dass Drawn Together die erste animierte Reality Show sei, in der acht Zeichentrick-Figuren gewollt zusammen in einem Haus leben. In manchen Episoden müssen sich die Figuren ein paar Herausforderungen stellen, basierend auf echten Reality-Shows.\n\nNach nur 3 Staffeln wurde die Serie jedoch wieder abgesetzt. \n\n","tagline":"Big Brother's Twisted Sister","contentRating":"de/12","studio":"Rough Draft Studios","genres":["Animation","Komödie","Reality"],"cast":["Cree Summer","Jess Harnell","Tara Strong","James Arnold Taylor","Abbey DiGregorio","Adam Carolla","Jack Plotnick","Chris Edgerly","Billy West","Phil LaMarr","Alex Borstein","Jonathan Kimmel"],"thumbFile":"Show -
