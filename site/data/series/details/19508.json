{"ratingKey":19508,"type":"tv","title":"Longmire","year":2012,"summary":"Walt Longmire ist Kriegsveteran und Sheriff der Kleinstadt Absaroka County, alleinerziehender Vater und seit kurzem Witwer. Während die meisten davon ausgehen, dass seine Frau ihrer Krebserkrankung erlag, umgibt ihren Tod in Wahrheit ein düsteres Geheimnis, denn die Umstände ihres Todes sind mysteriös und bis heute nicht geklärt. Von der Gemeinschaft distanziert und von Selbstzweifeln geplagt, versucht Longmire schmerzlich, den Verlust seiner kürzlich verstorbenen Frau zu verarbeiten. Zu dessen Unglück will Branch, ein junger Deputy, ihm den Posten als Sheriff streitig machen. In dieser misslichen Lage gibt es jedoch drei Personen, die zu ihm halten: Seine Tochter Cady, Victoria, eine neue Kollegin im Department und sein langjähriger Freund Henry geben alles, um seiner Isolation und Trauer ein Ende zu setzen.","tagline":"No calm after the storm.","contentRating":"de/12","studio":"Two Boomerang","genres":["Drama","Western","Action","Krimi"],"cast":["Robert Taylor","Katee Sackhoff","Lou Diamond Phillips","Cassidy Freeman","Adam Bartley","Louanne Stephens","Bailey Chase","Zahn McClarnon","A Martinez","Richard Beal","Derek Phillips","Graham Greene"],"thumbFile":"Show -
