{"ratingKey":29118,"type":"tv","title":"Loudermilk","year":2017,"summary":"Im Mittelpunkt der amerikanischen Comedyserie „Loudermilk“ steht ein trockener Alkoholiker, der sich durchs Leben murrt und dabei bei verschiedensten Menschen immer wieder aneckt: Sam Loudermilk (Ron Livingston) ist nach seiner Abhängigkeit als Abstinenz-Helfer tätig ist. Er ist ein ewiger Pessimist, der kein Blatt vor den Mund nimmt und damit jeden in seiner Umgebung brüskiert. Durch seine negative Einstellung und sein loses Mundwerk bringt er sich immer wieder in unangenehme Situationen. Seine scheinbar einzige Stütze ist sein eigener Helfer in Sachen trocken bleiben, Ben Burns (Will Sasso). Doch auch bei dem brodelt es unter der Oberfläche. Ein wenig netter als zu anderen Menschen ist er zu seiner ungeplanten Mitbewohnerin Claire Wilkes (Anja Savcic), doch natürlich kann es auch zwischen diesen Beiden immer wieder heiß her gehen.","contentRating":"de/16","studio":"Primary Wave Entertainment","genres":["Komödie","Drama"],"cast":["Ron Livingston","Will Sasso","Anja Savcic","Timothy Webber","Tyler Layton-Olson","Mat Fraser","Brian Regan","Laura Mennell","Danny Wattley","Eric Keenleyside","Jackie Flynn","Ricky Blitt"],"thumbFile":"Show -
