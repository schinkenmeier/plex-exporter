{"ratingKey":12274,"type":"tv","title":"King of Queens","year":1998,"summary":"Doug Heffernan ist Kurierfahrer im New Yorker Stadtteil Queens. Er ist mit sich und seinem Leben zufrieden, mag seinen Job und liebt seine bezaubernde und aufregende Ehefrau Carrie, eine erfolgreiche Anwaltsgehilfin, die sich von ihrem Mann jedoch ein paar mehr berufliche Ambitionen wünscht. Doug ist einerseits ein typischer Vertreter der Spezies Mann, der seinen Fernseher liebt und mit seinen Kumpels gerne Sportübertragungen sieht, andererseits hat er aber auch ein sehr hohes Harmoniebedürfnis und ist ständig damit beschäftigt, die Welt um ihn herum im Gleichklang zu halten. Durch den Einzug von Carries verwitwetem schrullig-exzentrischem Vater Arthur wird die Ehe von Doug und Carrie immer mal wieder auf die Probe gestellt.","tagline":"Comedy That
