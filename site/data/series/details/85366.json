{"ratingKey":85366,"type":"tv","title":"Ghosts","year":2021,"summary":"Das Ehepaar Samantha (Rose McIver) und Jay Arondeka (Utkarsh Ambudkar) träumt vom Ausbruch aus dem Großstadt-Trott. Die Erbschaft eines Landhauses scheint ihnen den Neuanfang zu ermöglichen – sie wollen das Haus ausbauen, um Touristen zu beherbergen. Schnell finden sich zwei große Hürden: Das Haus ist wirklich in einem sehr schlechten Zustand… und es „leben“ dort die Geister von Menschen, die im Lauf der Jahrhunderte dort verstorben sind. Für die ist der Plan, ein Hotel in dem Haus zu eröffnen, der pure Albtraum. Doch wie wird man die menschlichen Eindringlinge wieder los? Die Geister besinnen sich auf ihre Spuk-Fähigkeiten – leichter gesagt als getan.","contentRating":"de/12","studio":"Joe vs. Joe","genres":["Komödie","Fantasy"],"cast":["Rose McIver","Utkarsh Ambudkar","Brandon Scott Jones","Danielle Pinnock","Richie Moriarty","Asher Grodman","Rebecca Wisocky","Devan Chandler Long","Román Zaragoza","Sheila Carrasco","Betsy Sodaro","John Hartman"],"thumbFile":"Show -
