Nachdem sich sein Bruder Alan hat scheiden lassen zieht er mit seinem Sohn bei Onkel Charlie ein. Ganz klar, dass dessen \"Malibu Lifestyle\" nun völlig durcheinander kommt. Nach einigen Anfangsschwierigkeiten läuft der Alltag in der Männer-WG eigentlich ganz gut, wären da nicht die ständigen Kontrollbesuche ihrer Mutter Evelyn. Außerdem versucht Nachbarin Rose alles, um nur in der Nähe von Charlie sein zu können.","tagline":"Charlie Lives! (syndication)","contentRating":"de/12","studio":"Warner Bros.
