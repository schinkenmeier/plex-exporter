Jeder steht sich selbst am nächsten. In dieser glitzernden und egozentrischen Welt gibt es einen Mann, der das Spiel zwischen Sein und Schein perfekt beherrscht: Don Draper, Star der Werbeagentur 'Sterling Cooper' und Liebling der Frauen. An seinem Stuhl sägen ehrgeizige Nachwuchs-Kreative, die keine Skrupel kennen, um ganz nach oben zu kommen... 'Mad Men' ist ein bissiger Blick auf die Sexy Sixties. Eine Zeit, in der Sexismus, Zigaretten und das tägliche Glas Whiskey noch zum guten Ton gehörten.","tagline":"Where The Truth Lies ...","contentRating":"de/12","studio":"Lionsgate","genres":["Drama"],"cast":["Jon Hamm","Elisabeth Moss","Vincent Kartheiser","January Jones","Christina Hendricks","Aaron Staton","Rich Sommer","Kiernan Shipka","John Slattery","Robert Morse","Christopher Stanley","Jessica Paré"],"thumbFile":"Show -
