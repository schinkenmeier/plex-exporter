Auf die (un-)glücklichen Überlebenden wartet ein Kampf um das Überleben in der Wildnis, den sie zuerst als Team angehen, das aber schnell in sich bekämpfende Grüppchen zerfällt. Die Erlebnisse werden ihr weiteres Leben bestimmen: Denn auch noch 25 Jahre nach dem Absturz und der Rückkehr in die „normale Gesellschaft“ müssen sie täglich mit den Auswirkungen ihrer damaligen Erlebnisse klar kommen.","tagline":"Die Wahrheit wird brennen wie ein Stich.","contentRating":"de/18","studio":"Entertainment One","genres":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller","Horror"],"cast":["Melanie Lynskey","Tawny Cypress","Sophie Nélisse","Jasmin Savoy Brown","Sophie Thatcher","Sammi Hanratty","Warren Kole","Courtney Eaton","Liv Hewson","Kevin Alves","Christina Ricci","Alexa Barajas"],"thumbFile":"Show -
