{"ratingKey":1781,"type":"tv","title":"Archer","year":2009,"summary":"Sterling Archer ist beim International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS) unter der Führung seiner herrischen Mutter Malory Archer als Agent tätig. Neben üblichen Agenteneinsätzen muss er sich mit der Agentin Lana Kane, seiner Ex-Freundin, ihrem Freund Cyril Figgis, dem ISIS-Buchhalter, und weiteren skurrilen Charakteren rumschlagen. Dabei werden alle Klischees bekannter Agentenformate bedient und durch starke Überzeichnung parodiert. Ebenso werden in kürzester Zeit ein zynisches und sarkastisches Dialogfeuerwerk geboten. Interessant ist, dass die Serie anachronistisch konzeptioniert ist, denn neben Technologien aus den 60ern und dem Feindbild des Kalten Krieges aus den 80er Jahren, gibt es die aktuelle politische Situation der 2010er Jahre wieder.","tagline":"Espionage never tasted so salty.
