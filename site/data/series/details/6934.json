{"ratingKey":6934,"type":"tv","title":"Industry","year":2020,"summary":"Die britische Serie Industry folgt einer Gruppe junger Hochschulabsolventen im Jahre 2008, die um eine begrenzte Anzahl von Festanstellungen bei einer Top-Investmentbank in London konkurrieren. Doch die Grenzen zwischen Kollege, Freund, Liebhaber und Feind verschwimmen bald, als sie in eine Unternehmenskultur eintauchen, die ebenso sehr durch Sex, Drogen und Ego wie durch Geschäfte und Dividenden definiert ist. Während die Mitglieder der Gruppe auf- und absteigen, müssen sie entscheiden, ob es im Leben um mehr geht als um das Endergebnis.","tagline":"Risk. Reward.
