{"ratingKey":12842,"type":"tv","title":"Das Büro","year":2005,"summary":"In der Papiergroßhandelsfirma Dunder Mifflin herrscht der alltägliche Bürowahnsinn. Verkaufsleiter Michael Scott hält sich für einen lustigen Entertainer und den besten Chef der Welt. Für weitere Egokrämpfe sorgt der pedantische Nerd Dwight Schrute, der um Michaels Posten buhlt. Zum bunten Büro-Team gehören u. a. der talentierte wie unterforderte Jim Halpert, die scheue Sekretärin Pam Beesly, der übermotivierte Ryan Howard sowie der spätere Regionalmanager Andy Bernard und die ehrgeizige Karrierefrau Karen Filippelli. Zusammen sabotieren sie die Langeweile und Arbeitspflicht des lästigen Alltags, der im fröhlichen Chaos versinkt.","tagline":"Eine Comedy für alle, deren Boss ein Idiot ist.","contentRating":"de/12","studio":"Universal Television","genres":["Komödie"],"cast":["Rainn Wilson","John Krasinski","Jenna Fischer","Leslie David Baker","Brian Baumgartner","Angela Kinsey","Kate Flannery","Phyllis Smith","Creed Bratton","Oscar Nuñez","B.J.
