{"ratingKey":5936,"type":"tv","title":"Game of Thrones","year":2011,"summary":"Die Handlung ist in einer fiktiven Welt angesiedelt und spielt auf den Kontinenten Westeros, den Sieben Königreichen sowie im Gebiet der \"Mauer\" und jenseits davon im Norden und Essos. In dieser Welt ist die Länge der Sommer und Winter unvorhersehbar und variabel; eine Jahreszeit kann Jahre oder sogar Jahrzehnte dauern. Der Handlungsort auf dem Kontinent Westeros in den Sieben Königreichen ähnelt dabei stark dem mittelalterlichen Europa. Die Geschichte spielt am Ende eines langen Sommers und wird in drei Handlungssträngen weitgehend parallel erzählt. In den Sieben Königreichen bauen sich zwischen den mächtigsten Adelshäusern des Reiches Spannungen auf, die schließlich zum offenen Thronkampf führen. Gleichzeitig droht der Wintereinbruch und es zeichnet sich eine Gefahr durch eine fremde Rasse im hohen Norden von Westeros ab.","tagline":"Das Lied von Eis und Feuer","contentRating":"de/16","studio":"Revolution Sun Studios","genres":["Action","Adventure","Drama","Fantasy","Sci-Fi & Fantasy"],"cast":["Peter Dinklage","Kit Harington","Nikolaj Coster-Waldau","Emilia Clarke","Maisie Williams","Isaac Hempstead Wright","Sophie Turner","Iain Glen","John Bradley","Lena Headey","Liam Cunningham","Alfie Allen"],"thumbFile":"Show -
