Bryan Cranston verkörpert einen eigentlich über jeden Zweifel erhabenen Richter. Dessen Sohn verursacht einen Autounfall und begeht danach Fahrerflucht – ein junger Mann landet durch seine Verletzungen im Koma. Als sich dann auch noch herausstellt, dass das Unfallopfer der Sohn eines einflussreichen Mitglieds der Unterwelt war, sind schließlich alle Schichten des „Big Easy“ in den Fall verwickelt.","tagline":"Wie weit würdest du gehen, um dein Kind zu retten?","contentRating":"de/18","studio":"King Size Productions","genres":["Drama","Krimi","Thriller"],"cast":["Bryan Cranston","Hope Davis","Isiah Whitlock, Jr.","Michael Stuhlbarg","Lilli Kay","Benjamin Flores Jr.","Jimi Stanton","Keith Machekanyanga","Andrene Ward-Hammond","Amy Landecker","Tony Curran","Carmen Ejogo"],"thumbFile":"Show - Your Honor [28133].images/Your Honor [28133].thumb.jpg","ids":{"imdb":"tt7440726","tmdb":"86430","tvdb":"359579"},"seasons":[{"ratingKey":28134,"seasonNumber":1,"title":"Staffel 1","year":2020,"thumbFile":"Show - Your Honor [28133].images/Your Honor - Staffel 1 [28134].thumb.jpg","episodes":[{"ratingKey":28135,"seasonNumber":1,"episodeNumber":1,"seasonEpisode":"S01E01","title":"Teil 1","durationMin":54,"durationHuman":"54m","originallyAvailableAt":"2020-12-06","audienceRating":7.2},{"ratingKey":28136,"seasonNumber":1,"episodeNumber":2,"seasonEpisode":"S01E02","title":"Teil 2","durationMin":60,"durationHuman":"1h","originallyAvailableAt":"2020-12-13","audienceRating":6.9},{"ratingKey":28137,"seasonNumber":1,"episodeNumber":3,"seasonEpisode":"S01E03","title":"Teil 3","durationMin":55,"durationHuman":"55m","originallyAvailableAt":"2020-12-20","audienceRating":7},{"ratingKey":28138,"seasonNumber":1,"episodeNumber":4,"seasonEpisode":"S01E04","title":"Teil 4","durationMin":56,"durationHuman":"56m","originallyAvailableAt":"2020-12-27","audienceRating":6.9},{"ratingKey":28139,"seasonNumber":1,"episodeNumber":5,"seasonEpisode":"S01E05","title":"Teil 5","durationMin":51,"durationHuman":"51m","originallyAvailableAt":"2021-01-03","audienceRating":7.1},{"ratingKey":28140,"seasonNumber":1,"episodeNumber":6,"seasonEpisode":"S01E06","title":"Teil 6","durationMin":54,"durationHuman":"54m","originallyAvailableAt":"2021-01-10","audienceRating":7},{"ratingKey":28141,"seasonNumber":1,"episodeNumber":7,"seasonEpisode":"S01E07","title":"Teil 7","durationMin":53,"durationHuman":"53m","originallyAvailableAt":"2021-01-17","audienceRating":7.3},{"ratingKey":28142,"seasonNumber":1,"episodeNumber":8,"seasonEpisode":"S01E08","title":"Teil 8","durationMin":55,"durationHuman":"55m","originallyAvailableAt":"2021-01-31","audienceRating":6.9},{"ratingKey":28143,"seasonNumber":1,"episodeNumber":9,"seasonEpisode":"S01E09","title":"Teil 9","durationMin":49,"durationHuman":"49m","originallyAvailableAt":"2021-02-07","audienceRating":7},{"ratingKey":28144,"seasonNumber":1,"episodeNumber":10,"seasonEpisode":"S01E10","title":"Teil 10","durationMin":56,"durationHuman":"56m","originallyAvailableAt":"2021-02-14","audienceRating":7.7}]},{"ratingKey":28145,"seasonNumber":2,"title":"Staffel 2","year":2023,"thumbFile":"Show - Your Honor [28133].images/Your Honor - Staffel 2 [28145].thumb.jpg","episodes":[{"ratingKey":28146,"seasonNumber":2,"episodeNumber":1,"seasonEpisode":"S02E01","title":"Teil 11","durationMin":51,"durationHuman":"51m","originallyAvailableAt":"2023-01-15","audienceRating":7.2},{"ratingKey":28147,"seasonNumber":2,"episodeNumber":2,"seasonEpisode":"S02E02","title":"Teil 12","durationMin":50,"durationHuman":"50m","originallyAvailableAt":"2023-01-22","audienceRating":6.7},{"ratingKey":28148,"seasonNumber":2,"episodeNumber":3,"seasonEpisode":"S02E03","title":"Teil 13","durationMin":57,"durationHuman":"57m","originallyAvailableAt":"2023-01-29","audienceRating":7.2},{"ratingKey":28149,"seasonNumber":2,"episodeNumber":4,"seasonEpisode":"S02E04","title":"Teil 14","durationMin":52,"durationHuman":"52m","originallyAvailableAt":"2023-02-05","audienceRating":7.3},{"ratingKey":28150,"seasonNumber":2,"episodeNumber":5,"seasonEpisode":"S02E05","title":"Teil 15","durationMin":51,"durationHuman":"51m","originallyAvailableAt":"2023-02-12","audienceRating":7.3},{"ratingKey":28151,"seasonNumber":2,"episodeNumber":6,"seasonEpisode":"S02E06","title":"Teil 16","durationMin":54,"durationHuman":"54m","originallyAvailableAt":"2023-02-19","audienceRating":7.6},{"ratingKey":28152,"seasonNumber":2,"episodeNumber":7,"seasonEpisode":"S02E07","title":"Teil 17","durationMin":56,"durationHuman":"56m","originallyAvailableAt":"2023-02-26","audienceRating":7.8},{"ratingKey":28153,"seasonNumber":2,"episodeNumber":8,"seasonEpisode":"S02E08","title":"Teil 18","durationMin":52,"durationHuman":"52m","originallyAvailableAt":"2023-03-05","audienceRating":7.5},{"ratingKey":28154,"seasonNumber":2,"episodeNumber":9,"seasonEpisode":"S02E09","title":"Teil 19","durationMin":55,"durationHuman":"55m","originallyAvailableAt":"2023-03-12","audienceRating":7.7},{"ratingKey":28155,"seasonNumber":2,"episodeNumber":10,"seasonEpisode":"S02E10","title":"Teil 20","durationMin":59,"durationHuman":"59m","originallyAvailableAt":"2023-03-19","audienceRating":7.9}]}]}
