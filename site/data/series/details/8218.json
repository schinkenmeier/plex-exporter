California","year":2003,"summary":"Als der Anwalt Sandy Cohen den 16-jährigen Ryan Atwood, einen rebellischen jungen Mann aus schwierigen Verhältnissen, vor dem Gefängnis bewahrt, erkennt er die Intelligenz des Jungen. Fest entschlossen, sein Potential nicht auf den Straßen Chinos ungenutzt vergehen lassen, beschließt er, den Jungen zu sich nach Hause in den noblen Vorort Newport Beach zu nehmen - sehr zum Mißfallen seiner Frau Kirsten. Doch sie ist nicht die einzige deren Leben durch Ryans Auftauchen grundlegend verändert wird, auch Ryan muss feststellen, dass das Leben der Reichen und Schönen sich kaum von dem auf den Straßen von Chino unterscheidet: Hinter der glitzernden Fassade wohnen Neid, Mißgunst, Betrug und Hass.","tagline":"The O.C.
