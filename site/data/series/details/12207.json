{"ratingKey":12207,"type":"tv","title":"The Great","year":2020,"summary":"Die satirische Serie „The Great“ zeigt auf unorthodoxe Weise den Weg von Katharina der Großen  zur Macht im Russland des 18. Jahrhunderts. Die junge deutsche Adlige Sophie Auguste Frederike wird aus machtpolitischen Gründen mit dem russischen Thronfolger verheiratet, später Peter III. genannt. Doch die Ehe steht unter keinem guten Stern, da sich Peter als fürchterliche Person herausstellt. Als Schwester im Geiste stellt sich ihre Magd Marial heraus, die der nun Katharina genannten Königin eröffnet, dass der Thron in Russland automatisch an die Königin geht, sollte es keinen männlichen Erben geben und der König sterben. Für Katharina klingt diese Feststellung wie eine hervorragende Herausforderung.","tagline":"Wenn die Krone passt … nimm sie.","contentRating":"de/16","studio":"MRC","genres":["Drama","Komödie","Biography","Historie"],"cast":["Elle Fanning","Phoebe Fox","Gwilym Lee","Adam Godley","Douglas Hodge","Belinda Bromilow","Bayo Gbadamosi","Nicholas Hoult","Florence Keith-Roach","Charity Wakefield","Sacha Dhawan","Grace Molony"],"thumbFile":"Show -
