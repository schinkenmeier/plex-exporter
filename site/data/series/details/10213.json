Die liebenswürdigste aller Kreaturen ist SpongeBob Schwammkopf. Er lebt in einer Ananas zusammen mit seinem Haustier, der Schnecke Gary, und arbeitet in dem Fast-Food-Restaurant Krosse Krabbe. In seiner Nachbarschaft wohnen der griesgrämige Thaddäus Tentakel und der begeisterungsfähige, aber dumme Seestern Patrick Star. In jeder Folge stürzen sich SpongeBob und seine Freunde in neue, haarsträubende Aktivitäten.","tagline":"Bigger. Better.
