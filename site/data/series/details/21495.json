{"ratingKey":21495,"type":"tv","title":"ALF","year":1986,"summary":"Nachdem er mit seinem Raumschiff eine Bruchlandung durchs Garagendach hingelegt hat, nimmt Familie Tanner den Außerirdischen ALF bei sich zu Hause auf. Fortan gilt es, das Witze erzählende und Chaos stiftende Zottelvieh vor den Nachbarn und dem Militär zu verstecken und die Hauskatze vor seinem ungewöhnlichen Appetit zu beschützen. Allerdings wünscht sich der liebenswert-durchgeknallte ALF doch immer wieder ein Wiedersehen mit den anderen Überlebenden seines explodierten Heimatplaneten.","contentRating":"de/0","studio":"Alien Productions","genres":["Komödie","Drama","Familie","Science Fiction"],"cast":["Paul Fusco","Andrea Elson","Max Wright","Anne Schedeen","Benji Gregory","John LaMotta","Liz Sheridan","Josh Blake","Anne Meara","Jim J.
