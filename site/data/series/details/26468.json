Sie kommt mit einer Nachbarsfamilie in Kontakt, der der skrupellose Eisenbahn-Tycoon George Russell vorsteht. Dessen Sohn ist der schnittige und zugängliche Larry, daneben gehört die ehrgeizige Ehefrau Bertha zur Familie. Die Tatsache, dass die Russells eben erst „kürzlich“ zu ihrem Reichtum gekommen sind, bildet eine Barriere für den Einstieg in die höhere Gesellschaft, in der Familientradition groß geschrieben wird. Marian stößt in eine neue Welt vor, die sich direkt vor ihrer Haustür befindet.","tagline":"What's your family worth?","contentRating":"de/12","studio":"Universal Television","genres":["Drama"],"cast":["Carrie Coon","Morgan Spector","Louisa Jacobson","Denée Benton","Taissa Farmiga","Harry Richardson","Blake Ritson","Simon Jones","Jack Gilpin","Ben Ahlers","Celia Keenan-Bolger","Debra Monk"],"thumbFile":"Show -
