Die Serie begleitet im Mockumentary-Stil den Alltag des Grünflächenamtes der Stadt, das für Parks und Freizeiteinrichtungen zuständig ist. Die Autoren der Serie haben sich im Vorfeld intensiv mit der Kommunalpolitik in Kalifornien beschäftigt und die Behörden vor Ort besucht, um die Serie vor einem realistischen Hintergrund zu drehen.","tagline":"Because parks don't grow on trees.","contentRating":"de/16","studio":"Universal Television","genres":["Komödie"],"cast":["Amy Poehler","Aziz Ansari","Nick Offerman","Aubrey
