Umweltkatastrophen haben dafür gesorgt, dass ein Großteil der weiblichen Bevölkerung unfruchtbar geworden ist. Unter dem Namen Gilead hat sich ein Teil der USA abgespalten.\n\nDesfred ist eine der wenigen noch fruchtbaren Frauen und arbeitet als Magd im Palast des Commanders. Sie gehört einer Kaste von Frauen an, die zu sexueller Dienerschaft gezwungen werden als Teil eines letzten, verzweifelten Versuchs, Nachkommen für das verwüstete Land hervorzubringen. Desfred hat nur ein Ziel: die Tochter wiederzufinden, die man ihr genommen hat. Auf der Suche muss sie sich zwischen Commandern, deren grausamen Ehefrauen und anderen Mägden behaupten, von denen jeder eine Spionin für Gilead sein könnte.","tagline":"Gesegnet sei die Frucht","contentRating":"de/16","studio":"MGM Television","genres":["Drama","Science Fiction","Thriller","Sci-Fi & Fantasy"],"cast":["Elisabeth Moss","Yvonne Strahovski","Ann Dowd","Max Minghella","Samira Wiley","O-T Fagbenle","Madeline Brewer","Amanda Brugel","Joseph Fiennes","Bradley Whitford","Nina Kiri","Ever Carradine"],"thumbFile":"Show -
