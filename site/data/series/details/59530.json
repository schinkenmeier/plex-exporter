Nach einem schweren Schicksalsschlag ist er auf die schiefe Bahn geraten, was ihn letztendlich hinter Gitter geführt hat. Das Einzige, was ihn jetzt noch retten kann: eine zweite Chance. Diese erhält er in Form eines Resozialisierungsprojekts der Feuerwehr, in welchem Häftlingen Strafverkürzung versprochen wird, wenn sie bei der hochgefährlichen Tätigkeit bewähren. Bode nimmt an dem Feuerweh-Programm Teil und kehrt kurzerhand in seine alte Heimatstadt Edgewater in Nordkalifornien zurück, um der erfahrenen Feuerwehr-Crew im Kampf gegen gefährliche Waldbrände zur Seite zu stehen. Kann er sich im Dienst beweisen und sich endlich den Schatten der Vergangenheit stellen?","contentRating":"de/12","studio":"CBS Studios","genres":["Drama","Krimi","Action"],"cast":["Max Thieriot","Kevin Alejandro","Jordan Calloway","Stephanie Arcila","Jules Latimer","Diane Farr","Billy Burke","W.
