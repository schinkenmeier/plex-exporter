Die Mittdreißigerin leitet die NBC Comedy-Sendung \"The Girlie Show\", die im Gebäude 30 Rockefeller Plaza produziert wird. Als Lemons neuer Vorgesetzter Jack Donaghy auf der Bildfläche erscheint, ist das Chaos vorprogrammiert. Donaghy, dessen ganzer Stolz die Erfindung einer neuartigen Mikrowelle ist, kommt aus der Elektroniksparte von GE und hat keine Ahnung vom Fernsehbusiness. Nicht zu stoppen in seinem Tatendrang, krempelt er kurzerhand die Comedy-Sendung um und macht zum Entsetzen von Autorin Lemon und ihrer Darstellerriege den durchgeknallten Filmschauspieler Tracy Jordan zum neuen Star der Late-Night-Show.","tagline":"Work can be such a production.","contentRating":"de/12","studio":"Broadway Video","genres":["Komödie"],"cast":["Tina Fey","Alec Baldwin","Tracy Morgan","Jane Krakowski","Jack McBrayer","Scott Adsit","Judah Friedlander","Keith Powell","Katrina Bowden","Maulik Pancholy","John Lutz","Kevin Dotcom Brown"],"thumbFile":"Show -
